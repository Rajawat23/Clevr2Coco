# Clevr2Coco
The repository is build to convert Clevr annotation file to COCO type.
The idea is to pre-process dataset for easier Object detection/Segmentation training experience.

Thanks to authors at https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/blob/master/README.md for providing base code and 
https://github.com/StanfordVL/ReferringRelationships for providing annotations.
